# Fix Text Algorithm

## Overview
This is designed to reverse words in a given string while maintaining the order of words enclosed within parentheses. It is particularly useful in processing strings where certain segments need to be reversed, while others, marked by parentheses, should remain as is.

## How It Works
The algorithm iterates through each character in the input string. When it encounters words outside parentheses, it reverses them. Words inside parentheses are left unchanged. The algorithm also handles nested parentheses and removes all parentheses from the final output.
